 <h3>Avatar</h3>
 <p>
    On the lush alien world of Pandora live the Na'vi, beings who appear primitive but are highly evolved. <br />
    Because the planet's environment is poisonous, human/Na'vi hybrids, called Avatars, must link to human minds to allow for free movement on Pandora. Jake Sully (Sam Worthington), a paralyzed former Marine, becomes mobile again through one such Avatar and falls in love with a Na'vi woman (Zoe Saldana).<br /> 
    As a bond with her grows, he is drawn into a battle for the survival of her world.

 <h3>Deadpool & Wolverine</h3>

    Deadpool's peaceful existence comes crashing down when the Time Variance Authority recruits him to help safeguard the multiverse. <br />
    He soon unites with his would-be pal, Wolverine, to complete the mission and save his world from an existential threat.

<h3>Superman vs Batman</h3>
 <p>
    It's been nearly two years since Superman's (Henry Cavill) colossal battle with Zod (Michael Shannon) devastated the city of Metropolis. The loss of life and collateral damage left many feeling angry and helpless, including crime-fighting billionaire Bruce Wayne (Ben Affleck). <br />
    Convinced that Superman is now a threat to humanity, Batman embarks on a personal vendetta to end his reign on Earth, while the conniving Lex Luthor (Jesse Eisenberg) launches his own crusade against the Man of Steel.
